## AttenDone
### An app for students and teachers to simplify the attendance tracking procedure

### `Story Time`
Hi, I am Ragini Mishra. I am the creator of this application. While I was in college (2020-2023), I struggled a lot to keep track of my attendance (I was not regular so....it's more important to keep note of when you DID attend classes). Not only me but my teachers also had trouble marking attendance of students and keeping track of their monthly attendnace. Being a computer science students, I always wondered why they don't digitize this process. It's a shame that students studying such heavily automated field have to maintain something as attendance so manually. This gave me the idea to make a platform to ease up the process of attendance marking and tracking.

### `Tech Stack`
This is a **MERN Project**.
Here's a breakdown of each component in the MERN stack:

MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). It allows developers to work with dynamic and schema-less data, making it suitable for handling complex data structures. MongoDB is used as the database to store and retrieve application data.

Express.js: Express.js is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features and tools for building web applications and APIs. Express.js simplifies server-side development by handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and other essential functionality.

React.js: React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the user interface based on data changes. React.js follows a component-based architecture, which makes it easier to manage complex UI structures and provides a smooth user experience.

Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It enables server-side JavaScript execution and allows developers to build scalable and high-performance web applications. Node.js provides a rich set of libraries and frameworks, making it suitable for building server-side logic in a MERN project.
